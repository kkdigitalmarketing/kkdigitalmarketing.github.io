                                                    popular phenomenon towards half of the nation, but

                                            <p>If we look back to history, we see, digital marketing growth in India
                                                doesn’t take place overnight. It was the surge of
                                                the internet in India, quite an event itself which made the entry of
                                                digital marketing in the country. The year was 1996
                                                when very few people came across the word “digital marketing”.
                                            </p>

                                            <P>Gradually in 2000, people in India became more acquainted with SEO and
                                                digital marketing. But digital marketing is
                                                nothing but online marketing or e-marketing which needs a strong
                                                internet foundation everywhere.</P>

                                            <P>At that time internet was not a matter available at the fingertip, even
                                                one couldn’t think of full-fledged digital
                                                marketing growth in India whether it would be possible or not. So,
                                                despite being interested, people waited for the
                                                moment when the real growth would take its proper shape.</P>

                                            <h6>- Internet Era of India – 2008 Onwards.</h6>

                                                marketing strategy to the people of India. People
                                                noticed that the newly launched marketing formulas could also bring
                                                brand awareness and generate sales. So gradually in
                                                place of the traditional marketing methods like billboards, print ads,

                                                popular brands and small-scale businesses preferred to make small SEO

                                            <h6>-Future Of Digital Marketing</h6>
                                            <P>If we discuss the future of digital marketing in India, it is seen that
                                                the growth of digital marketing in India is very
                                                much prospective in the future too. Data says India ranks second in the
                                                world on the internet using list, just after
                                                China. By 2023, it is predicted that in India, there will be more than
                                                650 million & by 2025, 900 million internet users
                                                which is a massive number and can build easily a strong digital
                                                ecosystem in the country.</P>

                                            <P>Over the last few years, small towns and the rural belts of the nation
                                                have shown a noteworthy digital drive, according
                                                to a report which is 31 % of the population, adopting the internet
                                                actively in life. In fact, by 2025, rural India will
                                                precede urban India in terms of internet usage.</P>

                                            <P>As per data, 67% of the urban population is using internet listing,
                                                Maharashtra at the top, Goa at second, Kerala at
                                                third, and Bihar at the last, followed by Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.
                                                Moreover, we can see a direct impact of the Covid
                                                19 pandemic on online marketing platforms.</P>

                                            <P>It has accelerated the digitalization of the nation by generating 100
                                                million consumers towards a digital platform.
                                                Digitalization can be considered as the new concept of progress and it
                                                is the pillar of the economy, triggering
                                                promotion, reach, sales and payments everything under one niche.</P>

                                            <P>Digital marketing in India is going to be happening at a faster rate and
                                                the new trends are just about to show their
                                                magical performance in the online marketing sector. Study says, video,
                                                voice, and vernacular, the 3 v’s can be proved as
                                                a game-changer for digital marketing in the coming years.</P>

                                            <P>Even the government of India has started the campaign “Digital India”
                                                with a mission to transform the entire country
                                                into a digitalized one. Digital marketing is also a very cost-effective
                                                and affordable means if we compare it with other
                                                marketing platforms. For example, quality content on social media can
                                                entertain & engage a good number of people but in
                                                a pocket-friendly way.</P>

                                            <P>From small startups to business tycoons, everybody is nowadays preferring
                                                digital platforms to get visible in front of
                                                their target zone. So, following the popular note of today, it can be
                                                safely said, “Being Digital is Being Global”.</P>
